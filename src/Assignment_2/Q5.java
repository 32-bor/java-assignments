    /* How to identify whether a variable is value type or nullable type?
    A Variable is value type or ordinary type if its primitive variable. Value type variables are declared using
    Static Memory Allocation, eg, int x=10;
    A variable is nullable type or reference type if it is an object of any class, or it's a primitive type but
    followed by []. Nullable variables are created using Dynamic Memory Allocation, eg, String s;
